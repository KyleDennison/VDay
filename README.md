# Valentines-Day-Card
This is a digital Valentines Day card that can be easily modified to share! I created it the day before as a fun side project!

This project uses Java Fx to protray a animation of hearts that move randomly across the screen with a message in the middle.
Since Java Fx does not have a premade Heart Shape I created a method that takes in a radius and returns a Heart of that size 
using two semicircles and a triangle. I then set the Hearts translation path to take in a random value positive or negative, 
to ensure they start in a random postion and move in a random direction.

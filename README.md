# Valentines Day Card

![demo1](Pictures/demoPicture.png)

The goal of this project was to create a cheerful digital Valentines day card as a fun side project. This was accomplished using JavaFX to protray a animation of hearts that move randomly across the screen with a message in the middle.
Since Java Fx does not have a premade Heart Shape I created a method that takes in a radius and returns a Heart of that size 
using two semicircles and a triangle. I then set the Hearts translation path to take in a random value positive or negative, 
to ensure they start in a random postion and move in a random direction.
